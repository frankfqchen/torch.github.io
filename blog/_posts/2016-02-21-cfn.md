title: Collaborative Filtering with Neural Networks
comments: True
author: florian-strub
excerpt: Collaborative Filtering methods are a key algorithm for Recommender Systems. They are used by major companies such as Netflix, Amazon or Spotify to suggest items to users.  While Neural Networks have tremendous success in image and speech recognition, Collaborative Filtering received less attention as it deals with sparse inputs/targets. After a quick introduction to Recommendation Systems, we show how to implement Autoencoders to perform Collaborative Filtering.

<!---# Recurrent Model of Visual Attention-->

Deep Learning has well-known state-of-the arts results in Computer Vision, Speech Recognition or Natural Language Processing.
This post aims at using Neural Networks on a new topic : Recommender systems and Collaborative Filtering. 

Recommendation systems are a subclass of algorithms that seek to predict the rating that a user would give to an item [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system).
One of the most successful approach of Recommendation systems is to use the explicit feedback of users.

Collaborative Filtering 



    
  - Classic fields: Image/Speech Recognition/
  Recommendation system
  
    - rank items --> rankNet
    - predict matrix of ratings -> CF / CB
   
This post focus on the implementation part. Underlying motivations, basic maths are explained in the following paper
 
## Problem description ##

Matrix of ratings

Create autoencoders that will fill this matrix.

## Sparsity ##
Sparsity big constraint
Picture Autoencoder

Autoencoder ~= dimension reduction


First step : use sparse representation
Torch.sparse
 
Data sparse 
implement parser


## Autoencoder -> Forward ##

Use SparseLinear... Slow
CPU -> use nnsparse.BatchLinear
GPU -> nnsparse.densify() + nn.Linear (Up to 10time faster)

Better implementation undergoing


## Autoencoder -> Loss ##
Unknwon rating??? 
  -> unknown = no error... 
  
  loss = sum (exist)
  
   Backward


## Autoencoder -> Better ##

Yes! Use mask noise
--> loss

Deeper? Yes, harder to train...


## Results ##

This is not deep learning. (look at the title :P)

Another field where the structure of neural networks return excellent restults
Autoencoders were used differently form what they think to do.

This is not naive implementation of neural networks, they are actualy clear motivation why it was likely to work.
The real surprise is : how well they work!

```lua
module = nn.SpatialGlimpse(size, depth, scale)
```

Basically, if you feed it an image, say the classic `3x512x512` Lenna image:

![lenna](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/torch.github.io/master/blog/_posts/images/lenna.png)

And you run this code on it:

```lua
require 'dpnn'
require 'image'

img = image.lena()
loc = torch.Tensor{0,0} -- 0.0 is the center of the image

sg = nn.SpatialGlimpse(64, 3, 2)

output = sg:forward{img, loc}
print(output:size()) --   9 x 64 x 64


-- unroll the glimpse onto its different depths
outputs = torch.chunk(output, 3)
display = image.toDisplayTensor(outputs)
image.save("glimpse-output.png", display)
```

You will end up with the following (unrolled) glimpse :

![glimpse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/torch.github.io/master/blog/_posts/images/glimpse-output.png)

While the input is a `3x512x512` image (786432 scalars), 
the output is very small : `9x64x64` (36864 scalars), or about 
5% the size of the original image.
Since the glimse here has a `depth=3` (i.e. it uses 3 patches),
each successive patch is `scale` times the size of the prevous one.
So we end up with a high-resolution patch of a small area, 
and successively lower-resolution (i.e. downscaled) patches of larger areas.
This carries fascinating parallels to how our own human attention mechanism may possibly work. 
Quite often, we humans can vividly see the details of what we focus our attention on,
while nevertheless maintaining a blurry sense of the outskirts.

Although not necessary for reproducing this paper, 
the `SpatialGlimpse` can also be partially backpropagated through.
While the gradient w.r.t. the `img` tensor can be obtained, 
the gradients w.r.t. the `location` (i.e. the `x,y` coordinates of the glimpse) will be zero. 
This is because the glimpse operation cannot be differentiated w.r.t. the `location`.
Which brings us to the main difficulty of attention models : 
how can we teach the network to glimpse at the right `locations`?

## REINFORCE algorithm ##

Some attention models use a fully differentiable attention mechanism, 
like the recent DRAW paper [[2]](#rmva.ref). 
But the RAM model uses a non-differentiable attention mechanism.
Specifically, it uses a the REINFORCE algorithm [[3]](#rmva.ref). 
This algorithm allows one to train stochastic units through reinforcement learning.

The REINFORCE algorithm is very powerful as it can be 
used to optimize stochastic units (conditioned on an input),
such that they minimize an objective function (i.e. a reward function).
*Unlike backpropagation [[4]](#rmva.ref), this objective need not be differentiable*.

The RAM model uses the REINFORCE algorithm to train the `locator` network :

```lua
-- actions (locator)
locator = nn.Sequential()
locator:add(nn.Linear(opt.hiddenSize, 2))
locator:add(nn.HardTanh()) -- bounds mean between -1 and 1
locator:add(nn.ReinforceNormal(2*opt.locatorStd)) -- sample from normal, uses REINFORCE learning rule
locator:add(nn.HardTanh()) -- bounds sample between -1 and 1
locator:add(nn.MulConstant(opt.unitPixels*2/ds:imageSize("h")))
```

The input is the previous recurrent hidden state `h[t-1]`. 
During training, the output is sampled from a normal 
distribution with fixed standard deviation.
The mean is conditioned on `h[t-1]` through an affine transform (i.e. `Linear` module).
During evaluation, instead of sampling from the distribution, the output is taken to be the input, i.e. the mean.

The [ReinforceNormal](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn#nn.ReinforceNormal) module 
implements the REINFORCE algorithm for the normal distribution.
Unlike most `Modules`, `ReinforceNormal` ignores the `gradOutput` when `backward` is called.
This is because the units it embodies are in fact stochastic.
So then how does it generate `gradInputs` when the `backward` is called?
It uses the REINFORCE algorithm, which requires that a reward function be defined.
The reward used by the paper is very simple, and yet not differentiable (eq. 1) :

```
R = I(y=t)
```

where `R` is the raw reward, `I(x)` is `1` when `x` is true and `0` otherwise 
(see [indicator function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function)), 
`y` is the predicted class, `t` is the target class. 
Or in Lua :

```lua
R = (y==t) and 1 or 0
```

The REINFORCE algorithm requires that we differentiate the 
probability density or mass function (PDF/PMF) of the distribution
w.r.t. the parameters. So given the following variables :

  * `f` : normal probability density function
  * `x` : the sampled values (i.e. `ReinforceNormal.output`)
  * `u` : mean (`input` to `ReinforceNormal`)
  * `s` : standard deviation (`ReinforceNormal.stdev`)

the derivative of log normal w.r.t. mean `u` is :

```
d ln(f(x,u))   (x - u)
------------ = -------
     d u         s^2
```

So where does `d ln(f(x,u,s) / d u` fit in with the reward? 
Well, in order to obtain a gradient of the reward `R` w.r.t.
to input `u`, we apply the following equation (eq. 2, i.e. the REINFORCE algorithm):

```
d R                 d ln(f(x,u)) 
--- = a * (R - b) * --------------
d u                      d u 
```

where 
 
  * `a` (alpha) is just a scaling factor like the learning rate ; and
  * `b` is a baseline reward used to reduce the variance of the gradient. 
  * `f` is the PMF/PDF
  * `u` is the parameter w.r.t. which you want to get a gradient
  * `x` is the sampled value.
  
In the paper, they take `b` to be the expected reward `E[R]`. 
They approximate the expectation by making `b` a (conditionally independent) parameter of the model .
For each example, the mean square error between `R` and `b` is minimized by 
backpropagation. The beauty of doing this, instead of, 
say, making `b` a moving average of `R`, is that *the baseline reward `b`
learns at the same rate as the rest of the model*. 

We decided to implement the `reward = a * (R - b)` part of eq. 2
within a [VRClassReward](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn/blob/master/README.md#nn.VRClassReward) criterion,
which also implements the paper's varianced-reduced classification reward function (eq. 1):

```lua
vcr = nn.VRClassReward(module [, scale, criterion])
```

The nn package was primarily built for backpropagation, so we had to find a not-too-hacky way of
broadcasting the `reward` to the different 
[Reinforce](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn/blob/master/README.md#nn.Reinforce) modules.
We did this by having the criterion take the `module` as argument,
and adding the [Module:reinforce(reward)](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn/blob/master/README.md#nn.Module.reinforce)
method. The latter allows the `Reinforce` modules (like `ReinforceNormal`) to 
hold on to the criterion's broadcasted `reward` for later. Later being when `backward` is called 
and the `Reinforce` module(s) compute(s) the `gradInput` 
(i.e. `d R / d U`) using the REINFORCE algorithm (eq. 2).
And then `nn` is happy, because with the `gradInput`, it can continue 
the backpropagation from the `Reinforce` module to its predecessors.

So to summarize, if you can differentiate the PMF/PDF w.r.t. to its parameters,
then you can use the REINFORCE algorithm on it. We have already implemented 
modules for the categorical and bernoulli distributions :
   
   * [ReinforceCategorical](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn/blob/master/README.md#nn.ReinforceCategorical)
   * [ReinforceBernoulli](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn/blob/master/README.md#nn.ReinforceBernoulli)

## Recurrent Attention Model 

![rva](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/torch.github.io/master/blog/_posts/images/rva-diagram.png)

Okay, so we discussed the glimpse module and the REINFORCE algorithm, 
lets talk about the recurrent attention model. We can divide the model 
into its respective components :

The location sensor. Its inputs are the `x`, `y` coordinates of the current glimpse location, 
so the network knows *where* its looking at each time-step :

```lua
locationSensor = nn.Sequential()
locationSensor:add(nn.SelectTable(2))
locationSensor:add(nn.Linear(2, opt.locatorHiddenSize))
locationSensor:add(nn[opt.transfer]())
```

The glimpse sensor is *what* it's looking at :

```lua
glimpseSensor = nn.Sequential()
glimpseSensor:add(nn.DontCast(nn.SpatialGlimpse(opt.glimpsePatchSize, opt.glimpseDepth, opt.glimpseScale):float(),true))
glimpseSensor:add(nn.Collapse(3))
glimpseSensor:add(nn.Linear(ds:imageSize('c')*(opt.glimpsePatchSize^2)*opt.glimpseDepth, opt.glimpseHiddenSize))
glimpseSensor:add(nn[opt.transfer]())
```

The glimpse network is where the glimpse and location sensor mix through 
a hidden layer to form the input layer of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) :

```lua
glimpse = nn.Sequential()
glimpse:add(nn.ConcatTable():add(locationSensor):add(glimpseSensor))
glimpse:add(nn.JoinTable(1,1))
glimpse:add(nn.Linear(opt.glimpseHiddenSize+opt.locatorHiddenSize, opt.imageHiddenSize))
glimpse:add(nn[opt.transfer]())
glimpse:add(nn.Linear(opt.imageHiddenSize, opt.hiddenSize))
```

The RNN is the where the glimpse network and the recurrent layer come together.
The output of the `rnn` module is the hidden state `h[t]` where `t` indexes the time-step.
We used the [rnn](https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn) package to build it :

```lua 
-- rnn recurrent layer
recurrent = nn.Linear(opt.hiddenSize, opt.hiddenSize)

-- recurrent neural network
rnn = nn.Recurrent(opt.hiddenSize, glimpse, recurrent, nn[opt.transfer](), 99999)
```

We have already seen the locator network above, but here it is again :

```lua
-- actions (locator)
locator = nn.Sequential()
locator:add(nn.Linear(opt.hiddenSize, 2))
locator:add(nn.HardTanh()) -- bounds mean between -1 and 1
locator:add(nn.ReinforceNormal(2*opt.locatorStd)) -- sample from normal, uses REINFORCE learning rule
locator:add(nn.HardTanh()) -- bounds sample between -1 and 1
locator:add(nn.MulConstant(opt.unitPixels*2/ds:imageSize("h")))
```

The locator's task is to sample the next location `l[t]` (or action) 
given the previous hidden state `h[t-1]`, i.e. the previous output of the `rnn`.
For the first step, we use `h[0] = 0` (a tensor of zeros) for the previous hidden state.
We should also bring your attention to the `opt.unitPixels` variable, 
as it is very important and not specified in the paper. 
This variable basically outlines how far (in pixels) near the borders the 
center of each glimpse can reach with respect to the center. 
So a value of 13 (the default) means that the center of the glimpse can 
be anywhere between the 2rd and 27th pixel (for a `1x28x28` MNIST example). 
So glimpses of the corner will have fewer zero-padding values then if `opt.unitPixels = 14`.

We need to encapsulate the `rnn` and `locator` into a module that would 
capture the essence of the RAM model. 
So we decided to implement a module that took the full image as input, 
and output the sequence of hidden states `h`. 
As its name implies, this module is a general purpose 
[RecurrentAttention](https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn#rnn.RecurrentAttention) module :

```lua
attention = nn.RecurrentAttention(rnn, locator, opt.rho, {opt.hiddenSize})
```

It's so general-purpose that you can use it with an 
[LSTM](https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn#rnn.LSTM) module,
and different glimpse or locator modules. As long as these respectively preserve 
the same `{input, action} -> output` interfaces (glimpse) and use the REINFORCE algorithm (locator), of course.

Next we build an agent by stacking a classifier on top of the `RecurrentAttention` module.
The classifier's input is the last hidden state `h[T]`, 
where `T` is the total number of time-steps (i.e. glimpses to take):

```lua
-- model is a reinforcement learning agent
agent = nn.Sequential()
agent:add(nn.Convert(ds:ioShapes(), 'bchw'))
agent:add(attention)

-- classifier :
agent:add(nn.SelectTable(-1))
agent:add(nn.Linear(opt.hiddenSize, #ds:classes()))
agent:add(nn.LogSoftMax())
```

You might recall that the REINFORCE algorithm requires a baseline reward `b`?
This is where that happens (yes, it requires a little bit of `nn` kung-fu):

```lua
-- add the baseline reward predictor
seq = nn.Sequential()
seq:add(nn.Constant(1,1))
seq:add(nn.Add(1))
concat = nn.ConcatTable():add(nn.Identity()):add(seq)
concat2 = nn.ConcatTable():add(nn.Identity()):add(concat)

-- output will be : {classpred, {classpred, basereward}}
agent:add(concat2)
```

At this point, the model is ready for training. 
The `agent` instance is effectively the RAM model detailed in the paper. 

## Training 

Training is pretty straight-forward after that. 
The script can be launched with the default hyper-parameters.
It should take 1-2 runs to find a validation minima that 
reproduces the MNIST test results of the paper. We are still working on 
reproducing the Translated and Cluttered MNIST results.

## Results

In the paper, they get 1.07% error on MNIST with 7 glimpses. 
We got 0.85% error after 853 epochs of training (early-stopped on the validation set of course). 
Here are some glimpse sequences. Note how the first frames start at the same location :

![locations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/torch.github.io/master/blog/_posts/images/output_8PHJ4z.gif)

And this is what the model sees for those sequences:

![glimpses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/torch.github.io/master/blog/_posts/images/output_Onbzrk.gif)

So basically, REINFORCE did a good job of teaching the module to focus 
its attention on different regions given different inputs. 
A failure mode (bad) would have been to see the model do this :

![fail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/torch.github.io/master/blog/_posts/images/output_6kgOs1.gif)

In that particular case, the `opt.unitPixels` was set to 6 instead of 12 
(so the attention was limited to a small region in the center of the image).
You don't want this to happen because it means the attention is conditionally independent of the input (i.e. dumb).

Here are some results for the Translated MNIST dataset :

![translatedmnist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/torch.github.io/master/blog/_posts/images/output_52iFki.gif)

For this dataset, the images are of size `1x60x60` where each image contains a randomly placed `1x28x28` MNIST digit.
The `3x12x12` glimpse uses a depth of 3 scales
where each successive patch is twice the height and width of the previous one.
Training with this dataset was started about 3 days prior to this blog post.
For 7 glimpses, after 193 epochs, we get 1.223% error. Note that the model is still training.
The paper gets 1.22% and 1.2% error for 6 and 8 glimpses, respectively.

Note : you can evaluate your models with the [evaluation script](https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn/blob/master/scripts/evaluate-rva.lua).
It will generate a sample of glimpse sequences and print the confusion matrix results for the test set.

## Conclusion 

This blog discussed a concrete implementation of a Recurrent Model for Visual Attention
using the REINFORCE algorithm. The REINFORCE algorithm is very powerful as it
can learn non-differentiable criterions through reinforcement learning.
However, like many reinforcement learning algorithms, it does take a long time to converge.
Nevertheless, as demonstrated here and in the original paper, 
the ability to train a model to learn where to focus its attention 
can provide significant performance improvements.
